**Where Every Patient Record Becomes a Clear Medical Story â€” Powered by AI**

Medistory is an AI-driven clinical assistant that transforms unstructured patient dataâ€”such as voice notes and documentsâ€”into structured, searchable, and summarized medical records. Built on Azure cloud and OpenAI technologies, it automates clinical documentation, accelerates diagnosis workflows, and empowers clinicians with real-time, natural-language patient insights.

## Features

**Automated Summarization**  
- Converts unstructured text into concise clinical summaries  
- Highlights key medical events, diagnoses, and treatments  
- Adaptable to various medical specialties  

**Real-Time Q&A**  
- Ask natural-language questions like:  
  > "Has the patient had any allergic reactions before?"  
- AI responds with accurate context-aware answers from the patient history  

**Audio-to-Note Conversion**  
- Automatically transcribes clinical audio using Azure Speech-to-Text  
- Transforms speech into structured **SOAP** notes with GPT-4  
- Enables hands-free, efficient documentation  

## System Architecture
![Medistory System Architecture](architecture.png)

**High-Level Workflow:**  
Audio/Docs â†’ Azure Blob Storage â†’ Azure Function (Trigger)  
â†’ Transcription/Summarization (Azure OpenAI) â†’  
Structured Output â†’ MongoDB + Dashboard + Q&A Layer

**Component Stack**

| Layer        | Technology Stack                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | React.js, Bootstrap UI                          |
| Backend      | Azure Functions (serverless), Flask (dev mode) |
| AI/NLP       | Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), Azure Speech-to-Text     |
| Storage      | Azure Blob Storage (files), MongoDB (metadata) |
| DevOps       | GitHub Actions, Azure CLI                      |

## How It Works

1. Upload audio or medical documents via an intuitive frontend.
2. Azure Functions are triggered to:
   - Transcribe audio (if present)
   - Summarize medical content
   - Format it into SOAP notes
3. All data is stored securely in Azure Blob + MongoDB
4. Clinicians can query the patient's history in natural language, with GPT-4 answering in real time.

## Current Limitations

- Requires high-quality audio/text for best performance  
- Lacks formal clinical validation  
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance in progress  
- Offline access not yet supported  
- GPT-4 may occasionally hallucinate medical facts  

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile App for bedside documentation  
- Multilingual Support  
- Analytics Dashboard to track documentation trends  
- EHR Integration via FHIR APIs (Epic, Cerner)  
- Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Auditor, Doctor)
